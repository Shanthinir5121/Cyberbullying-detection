# Cyberbullying-detection

Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. 
Cyberbullying is a growing problem in our digital age, and it can have severe consequences for 
victims. Online bullying can be particularly damaging and upsetting because it’s usually 
anonymous or hard to trace. It’s also hard to control, and the person being victimized has no 
idea how many people have seen the messages or posts. They can be easier to commit than 
other acts of bullying because the bully doesn’t have to confront their target in person. 
Detecting cyberbullying and preventing it is crucial in creating a safe online environment for 
all. Machine learning techniques have the potential to identify and prevent cyberbullying, as 
they can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that indicate cyberbullying 
behaviour. This can be done by analyzing social media data. The project involves the use of 
natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify abusive language and negative 
sentiment in online conversations. Before the comment is posted the detected instances of 
cyberbullying can be warned to the sender and prevented from being sent in a conversation.
